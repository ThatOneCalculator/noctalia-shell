## Dependencies

### Required

- `quickshell-git` - Core shell framework
- `ttf-roboto` - The default font used for most of the UI
- `inter-font` - The default font used for Headers (ex: clock on the LockScreen)
- `ttf-material-symbols-variable-git` - Icon font for UI elements
- `gpu-screen-recorder` - Screen recording functionality
- `brightnessctl` - For internal/laptop monitor brightness
- `ddcutil` - For desktop monitor brightness (might introduce some system instability with certain monitors)


### Optional

- `cliphist` - For clipboard history support
- `matugen` - Material You color scheme generation
- `cava` - Audio visualizer component
- `wlsunset` - To be able to use NightLight

> There is one more optional dependency.    
> `xdg-desktop-portal` to be able to use the "Portal" option from the screenRecorder. 

If you want to use the `ArchUpdater` widget, you will have to set your `TERMINAL` environment variable.

Example command (you can edit the /etc/environment file manually too):

`sudo sed -i '/^TERMINAL=/d' /etc/environment && echo 'TERMINAL=/usr/bin/kitty' | sudo tee -a /etc/environment
`

Please do not forget to edit `TERMINAL=/usr/bin/kitty` to match your terminal.

## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Arch Linux

<details>
<summary><strong>AUR</strong></summary>

You can install Noctalia from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/noctalia-shell). This method will install the shell system-wide.

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell
```

If you want the latest development version directly from the git repository, you can use the `noctalia-shell-git` package:

```bash
paru -S noctalia-shell-git
```
This will always pull the most recent commit from the Noctalia repository. Note that it may be less stable than the release version.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Installation</strong></summary>

This method installs the shell to your local user configuration.

Make sure you have Quickshell installed:
```bash
paru -S quickshell-git
```

Download and install Noctalia (latest release):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell && curl -sL https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell/releases/latest/download/noctalia-latest.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip-components=1 -C ~/.config/quickshell/noctalia-shell
```

</details>

#### Nix

<details>
<summary><strong>Nix Installation</strong></summary>

You can run Noctalia directly using the `nix run` command:
```bash
nix run github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell
```

Alternatively, you can add it to your NixOS configuration or flake:

**Step 1**: Add Quickshell and Noctalia flakes to your `flake.nix`:
```nix
{
  description = "Example Nix flake with Noctalia + Quickshell";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";

    noctalia = {
      url = "github:noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };

    quickshell = {
      url = "github:outfoxxed/quickshell";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      inputs.quickshell.follows = "quickshell"
    };
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, noctalia, quickshell, ... }:
   {
    nixosConfigurations.my-host = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

**Step 2**: Add the packages to your `configuration.nix`:
```nix
{
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    inputs.noctalia.packages.${system}.default
    inputs.quickshell.packages.${system}.default
  ];
}
```

</details>

### Usage

`noctalia-shell` offers many IPC calls for your convenience, so you can add them to your favorite keybinds or scripts.

*If you're using the Flake installation on NixOS, replace `qs -c noctalia-shell` with `noctalia-shell`*

*If you're using the manual install (`git clone...` and have it in `~/.config/quickshell/`) you can just use `qs ipc call...`*
